### Welcome

The **Finance Guide for SA Devs** contains carefully curated content to help you navigate the world of personal finance. As you progress through your career as a developer, your financial position will change and so will your questions about money.&#x20;

This guide aims to answer the personal finance questions that are top-of-mind - whether that be how to maximise tax rebates while working from home, figuring out how your salary compares to other developers or simply how you can better customise your banking.&#x20;

### Our partners
