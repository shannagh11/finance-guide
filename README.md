The **Finance Guide for SA Devs** contains carefully curated content to help you navigate the world of money. As you progress through your career as a developer in South Africa, your personal finances will change and so will the questions that you have about money.&#x20;

This guide aims to answer the personal finance questions at the top of your mind - whether that be how to maximise tax rebates while working from home, figuring out how your salary compares to other developers or simply providing you insights on how you can customise your banking.

Access to quality financial resources isn't something that is freely available, and therefore we have partnered with Investec, to provide in-depth insights from its experts. Investec are&#x20;

&#x20;In order to develop this guide, we have worked closely with members of the OfferZen developer community to ensure that the content we include in this guide is valuable and useful to you as a developer.&#x20;
