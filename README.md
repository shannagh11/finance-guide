# finance-guide
**Background:** Financial wellbeing is such a key element in anyoneâ€™s life and developers are not the exception.
Developers are often faced with financial challenges - they might do contracting work as a side hustle, they may work remotely or they might not know the best way to start investing their money. 
OfferZen's partnership with Investec gives us access to experts in the finance field, with a wealth of finance knowledge that we can tap into.
We have created this finance guide because we think is will be valuable to developers to have access quality finance content. 
**GitBook**: The guide has been created using GitBook. We welcome community contributions.
