# ðŸ’¸ Tax

Nothing is certain in life, but death and taxes. In our quest to figure out what personal finance questions keep developers up at night, we found Tax to be a topic that could not be avoided.&#x20;

Everyone's tax situation is different, and it is therefore important to consult a professional, but there are some tax basics that every developer should know.&#x20;

For example, did you know that you can claim a tax rebate if you work from home? In OfferZen's [State of the Developer Nation Report](https://www.offerzen.com/reports/software-developer-south-africa/), we found that 92% of developers in South Africa now have the option to work from home, so this is very likely applicable to you.

If you have further questions relating to tax, please submit them here, so that we can further develop this section of the guide and make sure it is useful to you.
