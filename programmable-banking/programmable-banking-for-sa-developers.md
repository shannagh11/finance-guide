Open Banking is an exciting movement that aims to enable banking customers with greater control and transparency when it comes to their financial data and banking experience.&#x20;

In the UK, the Open Banking movement has been driven by the PSD2 (Revised Payment Service Directive), which requires banks to release customer data and ensure that it can be shared with third parties. This has led to a lot of product innovation in this space - specifically around the use of open APIs that enable third-party developers to build applications and services around these banking instiutions. &#x20;

In South Africa, Open Banking is not a legal requirement, but we do see banks such as Investec leading the way in offering [Programmable Banking](https://www.investec.com/en\_za/banking/programmable-banking.html) to their clients.&#x20;
