> **There is a large/wider opportunity for growth and more choice when you go offshore**

SA's economy makes up less than 0.5% of the world's economic growth and the SA economy has only grown by <2% per annum vs. offshore economy at double that rate with more predictability. There are less than 400 companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, whereas there are 45 000 companies to choose from overseas.&#x20;

> **There are a number of ways that you can go about investing offshore**

1. You can start by focussing on stocks on JSE exposed to overseas markets.&#x20;
2. Single discretionary allowance - you can take up to R 1 mil overseas per year and there is no regulation to worry about here.
3. Foreign investement allowance - you need to apply to SARS for a tax clearance certificate and you get up to R10mil offshore.&#x20;
4. There are more accesible ways to invest offshore through unit trusts if you are just starting out.&#x20;

> **The rand is volatile and is affected by crisis event and therefore diversifaction offshore can shielf investors from this.**
